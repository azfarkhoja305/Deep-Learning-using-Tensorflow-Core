   * The dataset has been taken from deeplearning.ai [course 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/home/welcome)
   * The classification was implemented on colour images of size 64 x 64 pixels using a 3 layer neural network with 12288 input units, 40 units in the first hidden layer, 20 in the second hidden layer, 6 units in the output layer.
